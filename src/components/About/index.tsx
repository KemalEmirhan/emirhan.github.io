          Hey, I'm Emirhan ðŸ‘‹ {age} years old. I'm a Frontend Software Engineer
          with over 8 years of experience building high-performance web
          applications across various industries. Based in Berlin, I specialise

          designing efficient component libraries that accelerate development,
          and optimising web applications for seamless user experiences. By
