              Hey, I'm Emirhan ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; {age} years old. I'm a Frontend
              Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience building
              high-performance web applications across various industries. Based
              in Berlin, I specialise in React, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript,
              and GraphQL, with a strong focus on accessibility and web
              standards.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
              Throughout my career in fintech, media, telecommunications, and
              e-commerce, I've collaborated closely with cross-functional teams
              to develop scalable solutions. I enjoy modernising outdated
              systems, designing efficient component libraries that accelerate
              development, and optimising web applications for seamless user
              experiences. By combining technical expertise with a strategic
              mindset, I make architectural decisions that enhance performance
              and drive business success.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
              Passionate about creating accessible, user-friendly digital
              experiences, I'm always eager to stay ahead of the latest frontend
              technologies and continuously expand my skill set.
